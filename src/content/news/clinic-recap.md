Thanks to everyone who attended our fall technique clinic. We covered stance, motion, and 3 core setups for single and double legs. Athletes also learned how to chain defense into their first re-attack.

Key takeaways:
- Build the habit of heavy hands and constant motion
- Use angle changes to create openings
- Finish with crisp footwork instead of strength

We will repeat this clinic format each quarter. Let us know if there are specific positions you want covered next time.
