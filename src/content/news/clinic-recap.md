We are offering free club practices throughout the month of October to help athletes get rolling before the season ramps up. This is a great chance to get mat time, review fundamentals, and see if the club room is a good fit for your wrestlers.

Details:
- October practices are free
- Monday & Wednesday, 6:30-7:45pm
- Delta Middle School

Bring wrestling shoes and athletic clothing. Text or call the coach to confirm your wrestler will attend.
