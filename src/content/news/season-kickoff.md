We are opening the season with a free open mat for new and returning athletes. Come tour the room, ask questions, and get a short skills assessment so we can place your wrestler in the right group.

What to expect:
- Coach introductions and safety overview
- Short warm-up and movement drills
- Optional live goes for returning athletes

Bring wrestling shoes, a water bottle, and athletic clothing. Parents are welcome to watch from the designated area.
