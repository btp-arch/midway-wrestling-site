Parents and wrestlers, make sure that all who will be participating in club practice have an up to date USA Wrestling membership before starting. This is for insurance purposes for your wrestler and the school that allows us to utilize their facilities. USA Wrestling Memberships typically need to be renewed each year after the 1st of September.

Checklist:
- Active USA Wrestling Membership
- Notified coach via text/call/email that your wrestler(s) will be at the first week of practice

Need help? Text or call coach.
